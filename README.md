## Update!

After buying a split keyboard I've decided to try a layout with thumb letter. For English I _strongly_ recommend **Hands Down Promethium** (bottom heavy variant):
```
  v w g m [      ] \ . , ' z
  s n t h k      q a e i c ;
  f p d l x      j u o y b /
        r
```
Note: place rare keys (`q`, `j`, `z`) wherever you'd like. I also use combo `u + y` for `qu`, it's quite helpful.

For Russian I use another custom layout with somewhat decent stats (I guess):
```
  ё ы й г ю      ф ц к л ш
  и о а м х      щ д н р т
  у я ь с ж      б в п ч з
        е
```
Note: place rare keys (`э`, `ъ`) wherever you'd like. I also use a combo `в + ч` for `ться`.

After few months of practice I can say this layout feels good. I have only one minor complain about `г` key (I press it with middle finger btw). It will be nice to have that key on the right side. I've tried a combo `в + п` but result was meh.

Note: btw you can get a little bit better stats without thumb key (less sfb, more lsb), didn't practice it:
```

э и о а м х      ф д н р т ъ
  ё я ь с ж      б в п Й з
```

My current PBs on short MonkeyType tests (10 words, 1k set) are: for English is 92wpm, for Russian is 91wpm. So in terms of speed this RU layout is the same as Promethium and "safe" to use.

### But wait! There is more!

Searching a better place for a `г` letter results into new layout:

```
  э ы й ж ф      щ ч р п б
  и о а д ш      х в н т к
  у я ь с ю      ц м л г з
          е
```
Note: I use a combo `м + г` for `ться`.

The main differences are lower redirects and better `г` placement. This layout has more sfbs but it's not a problem because they come from strong left index finger. You can get better stats after switching `д` and `г` keys but then it will be too much load for a right ring finger.

In terms of comfort this new version feels the same (or maybe slightly better) as the previous one.

It seems like it's better to switch `д` and `з`:

```
  э ы й ж ф      щ ч р п б
  и о а З ш      х в н т к
  у я ь с ю      ц м л г Д
          е
